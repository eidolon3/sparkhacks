# Plant Sentry

`cd` into plant-sentry/backend, and run 

`"python main.py"`

If it doesn't work, make you you install the requirements

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once installed, rerun

`"python main.py"`

Open the index.html file


navigate from the homepage to the analyze page


once there open your files and find the image of your plant you need to analyze


finally click scan


wait a few seconds and read your results to see what remedies if any you need to take


To check another plant, clear and repeat steps 2-4


This is an app that will take in an image of a plant and will analyze it using AI to determine what type of disease it has


## Inspiration
A few of our member's family members work in agriculture, so we wanted to create a solution to not knowing how to treat a crop's diseases.
## What it does
Plant Sentry uses an AI api to analyze a photo of our user's crop looking for any signs of defects or disease, and explaining steps in order to remedy the situation.
## How we built it
We built Plant Sentry using HTML and CSS for the front end user interface combined with Python and Flask as the back end framework.
## Challenges we ran into
None of us have done a hackathon before or any sort of collaborative project, so going in we had no idea what to expect.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud that we got our project together and managed to get it to our goal in 24 hours.
## What we learned
We learned how to comprehensively use git as a team.
## What's next for Plant Sentry
Our future plans for Plant Sentry will be to develop a mobile app, save images for faster results, and the ability to ask the ai for further questions after the initial results.
